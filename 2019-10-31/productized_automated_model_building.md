# Productized Automated Model Building

Problem setup -> (data selection/pre-processing -> prepared data - until
data is ready) ->
(select/apply algorithm -> evaluate candidate model - until model is ready) 
-> deploy model
    + assess and optimize model over time

AutoML - hyperparameter optimization

3 state-of-the-art methods
- Random search
- Reinforcement learning / gradient based - ENAS, Darts, NAS, ...
- Evolutionary methods - Darwin, NEAT, HyperNEAT, Co-Deep NEAT, PBT, ...
