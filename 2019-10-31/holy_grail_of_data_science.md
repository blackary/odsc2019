- Louis Huard - product manager at Zepl
- Moon soo Lee - Creator of Apache Zepplin, Co-founder of Zepl

87% of machine learning models never reach production

Zepl: Data science and analytics platform for your entire team

Data Science (Jupyter, etc.) Notebook - a good place to make a quick catalog solution
- Describe data 
- Searchable, annotatable
- Can preview data
- Programmable -- can programmatically generate schema, etc.
- Easy to update

Model complexity - tradeoff between accuracy, cost & time -- choose 2

Most important thing to monitor: Prediction Bias
    - "average of predictions" ~ "average of observations"

Minimize handoffs as much as possible, and greatly increase communication
when that has to happen
