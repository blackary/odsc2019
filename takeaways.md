To try:
* Immediately practical:
    * Amazon SageMaker - ML Pipeline
    * MLFlow - Experiment tracking
    * quanthub - hiring tools
    * shap -- tool for explaining models
* For future:
    * NEAT - evolutionary model search for deep learning networks
    * TensorFlow 2.0
    * Deep Reinforcement Learning

Important ideas:
* DevOps for ML -- reproducible, accountable, collaborative, continuous
* Most important thing to monitor -- prediction bias
* Should this code even exist?
